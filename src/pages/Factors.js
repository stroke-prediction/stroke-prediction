                <p style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>
                    High blood pressure (hypertension) is the most significant risk factor for stroke. Blood pressure refers to
                    the pressure
                    inside the arteries. Normal blood pressure is around 120/80, while high-normal blood pressure is 120/80 to
                    140/90. High
                    blood pressure is when your blood pressure is consistently over 140/90. This is called ‘hypertension’.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Hypertension means that the blood is exerting more pressure than is normal or healthy. Over time, this
                    weakens and
                    damages blood vessel walls, which can lead to stroke, particularly cerebral haemorrhage.

                <p style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>
                    Smoking can double or even quadruple your risk of stroke. Some of the chemicals in cigarette smoke (such as
                    nicotine and
                    carbon monoxide) accelerate the process of atherosclerosis (narrowing of arteries). Clots are more likely to
                    form
                    because smoking thickens the blood and makes clotting factors, such as platelets, much more ‘sticky’.
                    Cigarette smoke
                    forces arteries to constrict (get narrower), which makes it harder for the thickened blood to move through
                    the vessels.

                <p style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>
                    Diabetes is a chronic condition in which the body is unable to utilise blood sugar. A person with
                    diabetes
                    is around
                    twice as likely to have a stroke as someone of the same gender and age, who doesn’t have diabetes. This
                    is
                    because the
                    high blood sugar levels contribute to the development of atherosclerosis (narrowing of arteries). It is
                    very
                    important
                    that diabetes be kept under control.

                    Cholesterol is a fat-like substance that is made by the human body. It has many essential roles to play,
                    but
                    it becomes
                    a problem if levels in the blood are too high. Blood cholesterol contributes to the formation of a
                    substance
                    called
                    atheroma, which sticks to artery walls and leads to atherosclerosis (narrowing and hardening of the
                    arteries).

                    per day) can
                    actually reduce the risk of stroke. However, people who drink heavily are three times more likely to
                    have a
                    stroke
                    (particularly haemorrhagic stroke), regardless of their age. It is important to limit your alcohol
                    intake.

                    Being overweight or obese can increase the risk of stroke. Too much body fat can contribute to
                    high
                    blood
                    pressure and
                    high cholesterol, and may lead to heart disease and type 2 diabetes. If you are unable to
                    maintain
                    your
                    weight within
                    recommended levels, ask a doctor or dietitian for help.
